# 🛠️ Choreboard Blog Series

> *AI-assisted, family-empowering, chore-gamifying magic — brought to life with Google Sheets, React, and DAKboard.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Choreboard is an open-source, AI-assisted, gamified family chore dashboard built by [Eric Chapman](https://github.com/ericchapman80) with help from ChatGPT. It combines the simplicity of Google Sheets with a custom React frontend, DAKboard visualization, and smart automation via Apps Script.

> “We used ChatGPT to co-design every piece of this — from scripts and sheet logic to GitHub issues, dashboards, and user flows.”

## 🧩 What It Solves

Choreboard tackles a common household pain: tracking chores, motivating kids, and keeping parents sane. It introduces:

* Required & bounty chores with earnings and points
* Approval workflow for completed tasks
* A weekly summary dashboard
* Google Form-based interaction (early phase)
* Visual reward charts via DAKboard
* Google login (coming soon in React frontend)

## 🧠 AI Assistance

ChatGPT served as the co-architect and pair programmer across all phases:

* 🧱 Sheet design and tab structure
* 📜 Auto-generating recurring tasks
* 🔧 Apps Script automation
* 💬 GitHub issues with labels and definitions of done
* 📈 Pivot dashboards and Form processing logic
* 📦 Markdown docs, README, and roadmap
