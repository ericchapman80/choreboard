## üìà Tab: Dashboard

Uses Google Sheets Pivot Tables and Charts to summarize:

- Total earnings per child
- Number of tasks completed
- Stars earned
- Weekly overview
- Leaderboard

---
## üßÆ Leaderboard Calculation

The `Leaderboard` tab is dynamically updated using Google Sheets formulas.  
It aggregates points from **Approved** tasks across both the `Required` and `Bounty` tabs.

| Column | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| Name   | Pulled from all users who completed tasks   |
| Total Points | Sum of approved points across all tabs |

The formula works by:
- Filtering both chore tabs (`Required`, `Bounty`) for rows marked "Approved"
- Matching users by name
- Summing the `Points` field from each tab

---

## üîÅ Validations

All dropdowns are enforced using **data validation** rules that pull from reference or user data:

- **Assigned To** (Required tab): sourced from `Users (Children)` column A  
- **Claimed By** (Bounty tab): sourced from `Users (Children)` column A  
- **Frequency**: validated from `Reference Data` column A  
- **Approval Status**: validated from `Reference Data` column B  
- **Completed?**: uses yes/no, optional for future validation

---

## üîÅ Automation Notes

Automation will be handled via Apps Script to:
- Generate recurring chores based on frequency
- Auto-update dashboard ranges
- Reset weekly values as needed

## üí° Notes

- The sheet is idempotent ‚Äî re-running the script won't duplicate tabs or headers.
- Data validation prevents user input errors by using dropdowns.
- The script auto-generates seeded tasks for clarity.
