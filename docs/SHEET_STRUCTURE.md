## üìà Tab: Dashboard

Uses Google Sheets Pivot Tables and Charts to summarize:

- Total earnings per child
- Number of tasks completed
- Stars earned
- Weekly overview
- Leaderboard

---

## üßÆ Leaderboard Calculation

The `Leaderboard` tab is dynamically updated using Google Sheets formulas.  
It aggregates points from **Approved** tasks across both the `Required` and `Bounty` tabs.

| Column | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| Name   | Pulled from all users who completed tasks   |
| Total Points | Sum of approved points across all tabs |

The formula works by:

- Filtering both chore tabs (`Required`, `Bounty`) for rows marked "Approved"
- Matching users by name
- Summing the `Points` field from each tab

## üìä Custom Menu Functions

The Choreboard sheet includes a custom menu that appears in the menu bar when the spreadsheet is opened. This menu provides easy access to key functions:

### Update Leaderboard
- **Purpose:** Refreshes the Leaderboard tab with current point totals
- **When to use:** If the leaderboard seems out of sync with actual chore completions
- **Result:** Updated point totals for all children

### Reset Weekly Chores
- **Purpose:** Resets all weekly chores to their starting state
- **When to use:** At the beginning of each week
- **Result:** All chores with "Weekly" frequency are set to "No" for Completed and "Not Started" for Status

### Setup Triggers
- **Purpose:** Reinstalls the automatic chore history tracking
- **When to use:** If history tracking stops working
- **Result:** Ensures changes to chore status are automatically recorded

### Manual History Entry
- **Purpose:** Manually add entries to the Chore History tab
- **When to use:** For special situations or retroactive entries
- **Result:** Creates a new history entry with the current timestamp

## üîÅ Data Validation

All dropdowns are enforced using **data validation** rules that pull from reference or user data:

- **Assigned To** (Required tab): sourced from `Users (Children)` column A  
- **Claimed By** (Bounty tab): sourced from `Users (Children)` column A  
- **Frequency**: validated from `Reference Data` column A  
- **Approval Status**: validated from `Reference Data` column B  
- **Completed?**: uses yes/no, optional for future validation

---

## üîÅ Automation & Scripting

Automation is handled via Apps Script to:

- Generate recurring chores based on frequency
- Auto-update dashboard ranges
- Reset weekly values as needed
- Log completed chores to Chore History

## üí° Additional Notes

- The sheet is idempotent ‚Äî re-running the script won't duplicate tabs or headers.
- Data validation prevents user input errors by using dropdowns.
- The script auto-generates seeded tasks for clarity.
- Chore History is append-only and not manually edited.
